HTML form with the following fields:

Name

Surname

Email

Age

Favorite color (a list of color
red, green, blue, white, black)

Contact preference (checkbox
by email, by phone call, via SMS

Submit button that when clicked, adds the information (name, surname etc) in anew row in the table below.

Validations: 
email: should be a valid email,
age: must be less than 120,
contact preference: must have at least 1 selected

The table should only be displayed if there are rows in it, otherwise a message of “no data” should be
shown. On smaller screens the table should be scrollable so that it fills the responsive requirements.

Remove a row by clicking on a “delete” button at the end of the row. A
confirmation dialog with “OK” and “Cancel“ buttons is req uired before deletion.

An “export” , that
when clicked, will open a modal/dialog window that will print
the JSON formatted list of all rows inside it. There should also be a way to close that dialog.
